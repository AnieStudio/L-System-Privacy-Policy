Privacy Policy L System

Note: The text of the Privacy Policy below has been prepared taking into account the App Store requirements regarding the collection and use of data ￼ and includes information about the use of Firebase services (Google Analytics and Crashlytics) for analytics and crash logs ￼ ￼. You can use this text for your app’s privacy page.

Privacy Policy L System

General Provisions

Welcome to the L System application (hereinafter – the “App”). This Privacy Policy describes how the App collects, uses, and protects your information. By installing or using the App, you confirm that you have read and agree to the terms of this Policy. The collected personal data is used solely to ensure the operation and improvement of the App. The developer (Gleb Serediuk) will not use or disclose your information to third parties other than as described below.

Collection of Users’ Personal Data

Information you provide: The App is intended for keeping records of clients for laser hair removal procedures. You independently enter and store personal client data in the App, in particular:
	•	Client’s first and last name – to identify your client.
	•	Phone number – to be able to contact the client (if necessary).
	•	Email address – if communication by email is needed.
	•	Photos – images before or after procedures (at your discretion to attach a photo to the client’s profile).
	•	Procedure information – details of performed laser procedures, such as the date, treated area, notes regarding the session, etc.

All this content is entered by you voluntarily for the convenience of working with clients. The App does not transmit this personal data to external servers – it is stored locally on your device. The App does not support cloud synchronization or backup on the developer’s server; the data is not sent to the developer or other persons. The App also does not require account registration: you do not provide logins, passwords, or other information to create an account.

Data collected automatically: In addition to the data you enter, the App may automatically collect certain technical and statistical usage data not related to a specific individual. This data is collected using third-party services (for details, see the “Third-Party Services and Analytics” section below) and helps us maintain and improve the App. Please note that the App does not collect any sensitive personal data, such as your geolocation, financial information, or biometric data, without a direct need and your consent.

Third-Party Services and Analytics

To analyze the operation of the App and track crashes, we use third-party Firebase services from Google, namely: Google Analytics for Firebase (for usage analytics) and Firebase Crashlytics (for crash reports). These services may receive certain data about your device and actions in the App. We guarantee that no personal information about your clients (name, phone number, photos, etc.) is transmitted to Firebase – only technical data and statistics are collected. In particular, Firebase may receive:
	•	Crash diagnostic data – anonymous information recorded when an error occurs in the App, including stack traces (sequences of program code calls) and data about the system state. This data includes, for example, the operating system version, device model, the amount of free memory and disk space on the device at the time of the crash ￼. Importantly, such reports do not contain personal identifying data of the user or your clients – they are needed only to analyze the cause of the error ￼.
	•	App usage statistics – anonymized aggregated data on how often and how many users open the App. For example, Firebase Analytics can record the number of active users and the frequency of use of the App’s features ￼. This data helps to understand general service usage patterns and does not contain your personal data.
	•	Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) – if you provide consent to tracking. The App may request permission (through the App Tracking Transparency system) to access your device’s unique advertising identifier (IDFA). If you grant permission, IDFA may be used by Firebase Analytics for more accurate analysis of user engagement (for example, determining the sources of App installation or assessing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns). If you refuse, the App will not obtain IDFA, and analytics will be performed only on the basis of anonymized data. Please note: we do not use IDFA to display targeted advertising in the App (the App does not contain advertising) and do not track you for profiling purposes – IDFA is used exclusively within the scope of App usage analytics.

Firebase third-party services may also collect other technical information (for example, the App package name, the user’s country based on the IP address, device language, etc.) to provide their functions. Detailed information about what data Firebase collects can be found in Google’s documentation. We use these services within standard settings, and all data collected by them is processed in accordance with Google’s privacy policies. You can review the Google Privacy Policy and additional information about Firebase privacy to understand how Google processes such data.

Crashlytics (crash reporting): After a crash occurs, Crashlytics automatically sends the specified diagnostic data to Firebase servers the next time you open the App ￼. We use these reports to find and fix the causes of errors and to improve the stability of the App ￼. Crash reports do not contain information that allows you to be personally identified — for example, they do not contain names, contacts, or the content of your records.

Firebase Analytics: Firebase Analytics runs in the background and collects aggregated statistics. This information helps us understand which App features are used most often and, based on this, improve the product. For example, we can find out the total number of App users, their region (country), and technical characteristics of devices (phone model, iOS version, etc.). All this data is collected without linking to an individual and is used in aggregated form. We do not receive from Firebase any data that would allow us to identify you or your clients.

Use of Collected Data

We use the collected data exclusively for the following purposes:
	•	Provision of App functions: The personal client data you enter (name, contacts, notes about procedures, etc.) is used in the App so that you can keep records of your clients and their procedure history. This data is displayed only to you in the App interface and allows you to efficiently manage records.
	•	Improving the service: Aggregated statistical data and crash reports help us identify what can be improved. For example, understanding the frequency of use of certain features or learning about errors makes it possible to optimize the interface and fix shortcomings ￼. All analysis actions are aimed at improving your experience with the App.
	•	Support and contacting you: If you contact us for support (for example, by email), we may use the contact information you provide and the details of the problem solely to respond to your request and resolve the issue. Any information received from you during support is not used for marketing. Your feedback emails may be stored to improve the quality of support.
	•	Compliance with the law: If there is a legal necessity (for example, at the request of law enforcement authorities in accordance with the law), we may use or disclose the necessary data to fulfill legal obligations. However, since most of your data is stored only on your device, our capabilities as the developer to access it are limited.

We do not use your data for any other purposes not related to the operation of the App. In particular, we do not transfer or sell your personal data to anyone for marketing purposes. We also do not use your data to train artificial intelligence or machine learning models – all information about your clients remains private and is used only within the functionality of the App.

Data Storage and Security

Local storage: All personal client data that you enter into L System is stored locally on your device. This means that the information is physically located in the App’s storage on your phone/tablet and is not transmitted to any remote servers. By default, the data remains on the device until you delete it yourself or delete the App. Please note: if backup is enabled on your device (for example, iCloud Backup), the App’s data may be included in the encrypted backup of your device stored in Apple’s cloud. This occurs entirely under the control of the iOS operating system and the iCloud service itself; the App developer has no access to these backups.

Security: We pay great attention to the protection of your data. Since the data is stored locally, it is important that you also take care of your device’s security. We recommend using a passcode, pattern, or biometric protection (Face ID/Touch ID) on your device to prevent unauthorized access to the App and the information in it. The L System App itself does not copy your data in plain form outside the device, and when transmitting any service information (for example, sending a crash report to Firebase) an encrypted HTTPS connection is used.

We constantly update the App to eliminate possible vulnerabilities and ensure up-to-date security measures. However, it should be remembered that no method of data transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Although we strive to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee absolute security of information if your device is compromised by malware or obtained in physical access by attackers. Please take care of the security of your devices and do not hand them over to untrusted persons.

Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

No sharing of personal data: We do not disclose the personal data you enter in the App (name, contacts, photos, notes, etc.) to any third-party companies or persons. This information is entirely under your control and is available only to you on your device. The App developer does not have access to this data and, accordingly, cannot disclose it to anyone.

Service providers: The only third-party recipients of certain data are the analytics and diagnostics services (Firebase) mentioned above. These services act as our “service providers” and data processors who help us maintain the quality of the App. Google (the provider of Firebase) may process technical data about the App’s usage on our behalf, but has no right to use it for its own purposes unrelated to improving our App. We have ensured that Google and other providers comply with proper security and privacy standards (Google is certified under major international security standards such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, etc., and acts in accordance with the GDPR as a data processor). Any data transfer to Firebase is carried out via secure channels. You can read more about Google’s privacy obligations in the relevant Google agreements and policies.

Legal requirements: We may disclose your information to third parties only in cases where it is directly necessary under the law. For example, if we receive a legally justified request from government authorities (court, police, etc.) regarding the transfer of certain data, we will be obliged to comply with it. However, since we ourselves do not collect or store your clients’ data on our servers, in most cases we simply have nothing to provide. As for Firebase data (analytics and crash logs) – they are mostly anonymized, but can still be provided to competent authorities if required by law. We never transfer data to anyone just like that or under a commercial agreement – only with your separate consent or in accordance with the law.

User Rights

We strive to ensure you have control over your data. Since the App works offline and stores data locally, you directly control most processing. This means that at any time you can implement the following options:
	•	Access to data: You can view all the data you have entered into the App directly in the L System interface. We do not have a separate web portal or server where your information is stored, so all current data is on your device.
	•	Data correction: If any client information has changed or was entered with an error, you can edit this data in the App at any time. Just open the relevant record and make the necessary adjustments. The data will be updated locally on your device.
	•	Data deletion: You can delete information either partially (for example, delete an individual client record or a photo) or completely. The App implements record deletion functions – after confirming deletion, the selected data is irreversibly erased from the local storage on the device. If you want to delete all data at once, you can use the function to delete each record manually or simply delete the App from the device; when the App is deleted, the iOS operating system clears all data associated with it. Please note: if you use iCloud Backup, deleted data may remain as part of the latest backup until it is overwritten or deleted.
	•	Data export: At the moment, the App does not support the function of exporting entered data to an external file or format. We understand the importance of data portability and may add such functionality in the future. For now, if you need to save information externally, you can do so manually (for example, record the necessary data in your own documents or spreadsheets).
	•	Withdrawal of consent to analytics: If you previously granted permission to collect IDFA (identifier for analytics) and changed your mind, you can change your decision in the device settings. Go to Settings > Privacy > Tracking on your iPhone/iPad and disable the permission for the respective App. After that, the App will not have access to IDFA. Even with analytics collection enabled, you can always refuse to participate in analytical measurements: to do this, simply do not grant consent to tracking when the corresponding system prompt appears. Crash reports (Crashlytics) are sent automatically; if you wish to disable sending crash data, you can do so by refusing to use the App or contacting us — we will advise on how to proceed (for example, in special cases Crashlytics can be disabled programmatically).
	•	Confidentiality of email correspondence: If you contact us via email (for example, for support) and wish your email and address to be deleted from our mailbox after the issue is resolved, please indicate this in your message. We will fulfill such requests to ensure the confidentiality of your communications. As a rule, we store correspondence only for internal support purposes, and it is not shared with anyone.

If you have any questions regarding your rights or want to exercise other rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws (for example, the right to restrict processing or the right to data portability), you can contact us using the contact information provided. We will try to provide the necessary assistance to the extent possible given that the data is stored locally (some rights, such as data portability, may require the implementation of data export functions, which are currently not supported by the App).

Children’s Privacy

Our App is not intended for use by children. Although the 4+ age rating on the App Store indicates that the App does not contain prohibited content, in fact L System is aimed at adult professionals (cosmetologists, laser hair removal specialists) and is used to keep professional records. We do not knowingly collect or request personal data from persons under 13 years of age. Persons under the age of 13 should not use this App or provide any information through it. If you are a child under 13, please stop using the App immediately. If we become aware that personal information has been obtained from a child under 13 without verified parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information. Parents and guardians are advised to monitor their children’s activity in apps. If you are a parent or guardian and suspect that your child under 13 is using our App and may have provided personal data, please contact us. We will help delete any data if, contrary to our rules, it has been collected.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

From time to time, this Privacy Policy may be updated. We reserve the right to make changes to reflect current data processing practices or due to changes in legislation. We will inform you of any significant changes to the Policy by updating the text of the Policy on the privacy page (in the App itself or on the App Store page). We recommend periodically reviewing this page to stay informed about how your data is protected.

The new version of the Policy comes into force from the moment of its publication (unless otherwise provided additionally). At the top of this document, we indicate the date of the last update. By continuing to use the App after the updated Policy takes effect, you confirm your agreement with its terms.

(Last update of the Policy: 03.09.2025)
